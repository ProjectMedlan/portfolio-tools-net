Read the data from your Portfolio Performance file and use it in your .NET Application.

## Install Instructions
Currently nothing to install.

## Roadmap
 * Export to csv file (for a quick overview or cross check with bank accounts)
 * Read dividens from DivvyDiary (also only needs to be ported from a local project)
 * Read further information from the file (there are plenty of possibilities). Check if there's something useful. (Added some TODOs to code)
 * Check: Deserialize XML to complete object - benefits?
