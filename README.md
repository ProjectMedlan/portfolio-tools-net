# Portfolio Performance Tools
Read the data from your Portfolio Performance file and use it in your .NET Application.

## Install Instructions
Currently nothing to install.

## Roadmap
 * Read the buy / sell data from the Portfolio Performance file (only needs to be ported from my local project)
 * Read dividens from DivvyDiary (also only needs to be ported from a local project)
 * Read further information from the file (there are plenty of possibilities). Check if there's something useful.

## Finished
 * 15.01.2022: Read the securities from the Portfolio Performance file
 * 15.01.2022: Added first unit tests
